## 2026-08-14 — Investigation and foundation

The legacy application was inspected as a product rather than treated as a
code port. Its most valuable ideas are the terminal-first layout, compact tab
strip, quick command dock, extensive theme controls, and a status surface that
keeps shell state visible. The new implementation will preserve those ideas
without preserving the React/Tauri split or its IPC cost.

The architecture review compared GPUI, eframe/egui, Warp's native stack,
Alacritty, WezTerm PTY components, and the existing `egui_term` adapter.
Eframe/egui won because it offers a credible native GPU path on all three
desktop platforms and a supported WASM renderer. Alacritty remains responsible
for the difficult terminal semantics. This keeps the first milestone small
enough to test honestly while leaving clean seams for a custom renderer later.

The first checkpoint is deliberately boring in the best way: a clean local Git
repository, an open-source-ready license and README, architecture notes, and a
private ignored directory for anything that must not ship.

## 2026-08-14 — The first real terminal

The native window now owns a real login shell through Alacritty's PTY/event-loop
stack. Input, output, live grid resize, scrollback, selection, tab creation,
theme changes, font scaling, command presets, settings persistence, and clean
window exit all work in one process. A manual X11 smoke test resized the window,
generated 220 output lines, scrolled backward through the terminal grid, and
copied a multiline selection back into the shell.

That clipboard test caught a useful upstream adapter flaw: its declared
Ctrl+Shift+C/V bindings did not dispatch the actions, and pasted text could be
mistaken for Ctrl+V when the asynchronous clipboard response arrived after the
modifier keys were released. The small MIT adapter is now vendored with a
focused fix and its original license retained. JetBrains Mono is bundled under
the SIL Open Font License so cell metrics and the reference look are stable.

## 2026-08-14 — One UI, safe browser demo

The application was split into a reusable Rust library and a desktop launcher.
On desktop the terminal surface owns an actual PTY. On `wasm32` the same egui
chrome instead renders an interactive, deterministic command sandbox. This is a
deliberate product boundary: the website can offer a convincing trial without
claiming or attempting access to a visitor's machine. A release-mode WASM build
now succeeds; the raw module is 4.4 MiB before `wasm-opt`/gzip or Brotli.

## 2026-08-14 — Pane layouts and lifecycle proof

The workspace now supports the three most useful reference layouts: one pane,
two side-by-side panes, and two stacked panes. Switching into a split creates a
second real shell when necessary. Each pane remains independently interactive,
resizes its own PTY grid, and visibly marks its backing tab. Clicking a hidden
tab swaps it into the focused pane. Closing either side normalizes indices and
collapses back to one pane when only one session remains.

The manual smoke test exercised both split directions with distinct commands in
each shell, then closed one tab and confirmed its bash child disappeared while
the surviving shell stayed usable. Finally the window was closed through the
desktop window manager (not by killing the test harness): the application and
remaining child shell both exited within the polling window.
